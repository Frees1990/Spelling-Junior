### **Lighthouse Desktop/Mobile**

- I ran the lighthouse both in google chrome and incognito mode in mobile and as well desktop. 
The First time I ran it it gave me : 

  - 43% perfromance and 100% on accessibility, Best Practice and SEO for my home page.
  - 75% perfromance 100% on accessibility, Best Practice and SEO.
  - 56% perfomance 100% on accessibility, Best Practice and SEO.
  - 99% performance 100% on accessibility, Best Practice and SEO.
  - 100% performance 100% on accessibility, Best Practice and SEO.


   I read through the list of things that I could improve on. One of them is compressing my images from Home page and Visa Process page which I did, after compressing my image, uploading it and pushed it on Github. 
   
   I tried ruinning lighthouse again, it gave me :
   - 75% perfromance, 80%  accessibility, 100% Best Practice and 89% SEO.
   Unfortunately, I wasn't able to screenshot the above and could not remember the rest. I do not understand why it affected the accessiblity and the SEO. I was reading through it and it's citing my CDN's but I cannot delete my CDN's beause they are necessary for my bootstrap code. 

The mose confusing part after hours and hours finding a way for it to get a green, I finally gave up. Open my deployed site again the next day and is now giving me a different score. This part of testing took me 4 days 5 hrs each day and still could not understand, unfortunately its nearly time to submit my project and I will ready through about lighthouse in my own pace to understand how it works. At the moment, to be honest I have no clue what I am doing with lighthouse but it would be interesting to find out what I did wrong and what I can do to achieve full marks on this testing. 

### LIGHTHOUSE LASTMINUTE FIX 30-01-2024

## **Libraries and Programs used**


## **Deployment & Usage**
### **Deployment**
To deploy my site on Git Hub I made the following steps. I found out how to deploy my project when I was playing around with github trying to fix my incorrect path which hinders my images to load up on live. 

These are the steps:

 - Go to the Settings tab of your GitHub repo.
 - On the left-hand sidebar, in the Code and automation section, select Pages.
 - Make sure: Source is set to 'Deploy from Branch'.
 - Main branch is selected.
 - Folder is set to / (root).
 - Under Branch, click Save.
 - Go back to the Code tab. Wait a few minutes for the build to 
 - finish and refresh your repo.
 - On the right-hand side, in the Environments section, click on 'github-pages'.
 - Click View deployment to see the live site

### **Fork**
  1.  On GitHub.com, navigate to the Visa-Chronicles repository.
  2.  In the top-right corner of the page, click Fork.
  3.  Under "Owner," select the dropdown menu and click an owner for the forked repository.
  4.  By default, forks are named the same as their upstream repositories. Optionally, to further distinguish your fork, in the "Repository name" field, type a name.
  5.  Optionally, in the "Description" field, type a description of your fork.
  6.  Optionally, select Copy the DEFAULT branch only.
  7.  Click Create fork.

### **Cloning**
  1.  On GitHub.com, navigate to your fork of the Spoon-Knife repository.
  2.  Above the list of files, click  Code.
  3.  Copy the URL for the repository.
    - To clone the repository us
    itory using an SSH key, including a certificate issued by your organization's SSH certificate authority, click SSH, then click .
    - To clone a repository using GitHub CLI, click GitHub CLI, then click .
  4.  Open Git Bash.
  5.  Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory.
  6.  Type git clone, and then paste the URL you copied earlier. It will look like this, with your GitHub username instead of YOUR-USERNAME:
  7.  Press Enter. Your local clone will be created.
